There is no advantage to taking diversifiable risk.
We therefore assume the behavior of your investments corresponds to that of the
relevant asset classes. This can be achieved using index based funds from
a provider such as <a href="http://www.vanguard.com/">Vanguard</a>.
<br />
<br />
Asset classes to consider:
<br />
<span class="small">
Stocks and bonds are sufficient for most purposes. <span class="advanced">Care must be taken
when interpreting the results for other asset classes because mean
variance optimization is very sensitive to small differences between
similar asset classes. Additionally, for more than two asset classes
with non-normal return distributions be aware that the results of mean
variance optimization are ever so slightly non-optimal even when the
returns are independent over time.</span>
</span>
<div class="advanced">
<div class="warning small">
Blindly selecting all asset classes will result in a recommended
portfolio of small value and gold, which is true according to the
historical record, but care needs to be exercised in interpreting this
recommendation going forward. Caveat emptor.

We use the historical returns record including its variance for both analysis and simulation.  However,
we allow the historical record to be adjusted to better match
projections for the future.  Historically, for the period 1927-2014,
the US stock market and US investment grade bonds returned geometric
mean real returns of 6.8% and 2.7% per annum respectively. Current bond returns
are however substantially lower than this, and going
forward <a href="http://www.advisorperspectives.com/newsletters12/Jeremy_Siegel_Rob_Arnott_and_Other_Experts_Forecast_Equity_Returns.php">many
experts also predict</a> lower stock market returns.
Any adjustment made to stocks or bonds will result in matching
adjustments to the other equity or fixed income classes.
To make things realistic investment management fees should also be
subtracted which typically range from 0.1% to 1.0% per annum.

After generating the recommended asset allocation, and during subsequent performance simulation, the performance of all asset classes can be downwardly adjusted, and the volatility of equity asset classes can be increased. This adjustment is made to the chosen return levels above.
