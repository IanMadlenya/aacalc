<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<dl>

<dt>What is utility?</dt>

<dd>

Utility is a concept in economics that assigns a number indicating the desirability of a consumption level or sequence of consumption levels. This relationship need not be linear; consuming $20k less per year may be many times worse than consuming $10k less year.
</dd>

<dt>How many years does the analysis of AACalc.com provide for?</dt>

<dd>

Rather than a fixed number of years AACalc.com uses a stochastic lifespan, and analyzes for all ages (up to 120) with decreasing emphasis placed on later years when the performance of the portfolio becomes less critical. If equal emphasis was placed on all years there would be a perhaps 50% reduction in consumption to handle the very small chance of living to 120. The loss in well being from doing this would exceed the loss in well being from the small chance of living to 120 and having insufficient funds available.
