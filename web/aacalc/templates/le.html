<h1>What is my percentile life expectancy?</h1>

<p>
The life expectancies most commonly quoted in official U.S. tables and
reports are wrong for retirement planning on 4 counts:
<ul>
<li> Mean vs. percentile - for retirement planning purposes you have
to plan assuming you might live significantly longer than the mean
reported value, such as the 95th percentile life expectancy, for which
there is a 95% chance that you won't exceed
<li> Individual vs. couple - for many, what matters is the life
expectancy of the last survivor
<li> Period vs. cohort tables - i.e. failure to take into account
mortality improvement trends
<li> Average health is assumed - yet the life expectancies of those of
below average health and above average health are quite different
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If you are using <a href="{% url 'home' %}">AACalc.com</a> you don't
have to worry about figuring out your life expectancy, the calculator
considers the full range of longevity possibilities automatically, but
if you are using some other scheme the information computed below is
highly relevant.
