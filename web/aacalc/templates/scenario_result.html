Comparison: <a title="Monte Carlo simulation. AACalc improvement is the additional expected well being you would receive in retirement when using AACalc and the selected portfolio compared to the named asset allocation scheme using stocks and bonds only and the 4% portfolio withdrawal rule. It excludes the well being from defined benefits. It includes any well being derived from leaving an inheritance. The target date fund is for the consensus target date fund as tracked by the S&amp;P Target Date indexes and reported by iShares as of June 30, 2012 but with all equities treated as stocks, and all fixed income treated as bonds. All schemes are modified to adhere to the specified risk tolerance. 50,000 random returns sequences are analyzed for each scheme. Each sequence is compared against the full range of longevity possibilities."><img src="/static/images/Information-icon.png" alt="[?]"></a>

In order for this number to be valid you need to follow the asset allocation recommendations contained herein. These recommendations are made assuming market returns are independent over time.

For cash, the assumption is manifestly false, but the variance of real returns on cash is small.

The consumption map is technically referred to as a heat map.
To read it you locate the year on the x axis, the portfolio size for
that year on the y axis, and then use the color of the point where they
intersect to determine the recommended annual consumption for that year
and portfolio size in accordance
with the annual consumption color scale on the right hand side.
