Comparison: <a title="Monte Carlo simulation. AACalc improvement is the additional expected well being you would receive in retirement when using AACalc and the selected portfolio compared to the named asset allocation scheme using stocks and bonds only and the 4% portfolio withdrawal rule. It excludes the well being from defined benefits. It includes any well being derived from leaving an inheritance. The target date fund is for the consensus target date fund as tracked by the S&amp;P Target Date indexes and reported by iShares as of June 30, 2012 but with all equities treated as stocks, and all fixed income treated as bonds. All schemes are modified to adhere to the specified risk tolerance. 50,000 random returns sequences are analyzed for each scheme. Each sequence is compared against the full range of longevity possibilities."><img src="/static/images/Information-icon.png" alt="[?]"></a>

For cash, the assumption is manifestly false, but the variance of real returns on cash is small.
