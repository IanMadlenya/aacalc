Comparison: <a title="Monte Carlo simulation. AACalc savings is the additional amount you would have to invest today when using the named asset allocation scheme to achieve the same well being as AACalc. It includes any well being derived from leaving an inheritance. The target date fund is for the consensus target date fund as tracked by the S&amp;P Target Date indexes and reported by iShares as of June 30, 2012 but with all equities treated as stocks, and all fixed income treated as bonds. All schemes are modified to adhere to the specified risk tolerance. 20,000 random returns sequences are analyzed for each scheme and proposed savings value. Each sequence is compared against the full range of longevity possibilities. Savings amounts are rounded down."><img src="/static/images/Information-icon.png" alt="[?]"></a>

Retirement number: {{ data.number }} <a title="Somewhat arbitrarily chosen as the smallest examined portfolio with a probability of failure below 5%. In order for this number to be valid you need to follow the asset allocation recommendations contained herein. These recommendations are made assuming market returns are independent over time. For equities this is a good first approximation, but it ignores phenomena known as volatility predictability, momentum, and reversion to the mean. For cash, the assumption is manifestly false, but the variance of real returns on cash is small. In addition mean-variance optimization assumes returns are normally distributed, however experiments show this assumption has little practical consequence."><img src="/static/images/Information-icon.png" alt="[?]"></a>
